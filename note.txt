Things I have learned from experience:
    - Simpler architecture is better especially in the beginning of building a NN
    - Using a dense layer earlier in an AE architecture is usually better
    - Decrease input size (32x32 works well) especially for sparse images 
    - AE is much worse with multiple objects
    
    - Encoder and Decoder don't need to be reverse replicas of each other
